Summaries for each timepoint pair for each year for each virus.

Format:
mean (95% CI)
success / total percentage (95% CI - Clopper-Pearson exact interval)

GMT/GMR correction was done like this:

t2_corrected = exp(log(t2) - b1 * (log(t1) - log(10)))

ratio_corrected = t2_corrected / 10

Where b1 comes from

log(t2) = b0 + b1 * log(t1)

Interpretation: second timepoint titre / titre ratio estimated as if everyone
started at 10.

Variables:
study_year - year of serology data
timepoints - the timepoints summaries relate to. Second vs first.
virus - virus name from serology data.
clade - whatever was in the parentheses after the virus name in the serology
data.
n_individuals - individual count
baseline - baseline geometric mean titre (first timepoint), original scale
gmt, gmt_corrected - second timepoint titre, original scale
gmr, gmr_corrected - fold-increase b/w 2nd and 1st, original scale
titre_above_40 - second titre above 40 proportion
titre_above_40_below_before - second titre above 40 but only if the first titre
is below 40
seroconv - if first titre below 10, then second above 40, otherwise a 4-fold
increase.
